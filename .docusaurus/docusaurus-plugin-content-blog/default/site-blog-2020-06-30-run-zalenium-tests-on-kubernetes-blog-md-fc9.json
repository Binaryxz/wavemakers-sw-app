  "description": "WaveMaker product team is able to make weekly patch releases and, feature packed releases every alternate months. Typically product releases involve testing of several micro services, APIâ€™s and User interface, functionality etc. WaveMaker platform is composed of several such services, and functional testing can be only done by building apps using visual drag-n-drop studio.
