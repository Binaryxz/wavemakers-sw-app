  "description": "Grid LayoutÂ is the basic content layout, that caters to multiple layout needs. Using the grid layout, you can divide your page content into cells or grids and place your widgets accordingly. It gives you a flexibility of widget placement without having to get into the intricate design details. The major advantage of using grid layout is its rendering capability.
