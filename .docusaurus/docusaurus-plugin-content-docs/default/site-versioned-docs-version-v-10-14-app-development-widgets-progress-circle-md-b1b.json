  "description": "Progress Circle widget can be used to show the status of any given event. It can be used to represent the completion progress of a task. Progress may be either indeterminate — meaning it is unclear how much work remains before the task is complete (e.g., the task is waiting for a response from a remote host) — or a numeric value between 0 and a given maximum, explicitly specifying the fraction of work that has completed.",
