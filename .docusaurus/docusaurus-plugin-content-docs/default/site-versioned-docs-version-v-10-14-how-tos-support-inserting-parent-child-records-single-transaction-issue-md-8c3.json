  "title": "Support for Inserting Parent and Child Records in a Single Transaction Issue",
  "description": "There is a known issue related to inserting the parent and child records in a single transaction with the versions 10.0.2 and 10.0.3. To avoid any conflicts, we have explicitly included the \"org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator\" file for cascading support. This can be found directly under \"src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.hibernate.integrator.spi.Integrator\" rather than loading it from the library as it was done earlier.",
