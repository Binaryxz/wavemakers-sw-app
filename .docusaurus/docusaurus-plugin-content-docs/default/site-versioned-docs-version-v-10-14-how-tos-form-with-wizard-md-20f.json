  "description": "Form with Wizard steps assists with the creation of forms with some sort of form flow. For example, if you had a large form for entering user data, you could use a form with wizard to divide it into a series of related steps. This has the advantage of not overwhelming users with a really long form and also giving them some indication of their progress as they enter their information.",
