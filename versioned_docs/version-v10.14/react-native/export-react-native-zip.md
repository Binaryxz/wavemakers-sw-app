A ReactNative zip is used to create a platform-specific installer. WaveMaker supports generating React Native installers for Android and iOS devices. When you develop an app in React Native Studio, you can export a zip from that project.

## Export ReactNative Zip using WaveMaker Studio

1. Go to **Export** and click **Project as ReactNative ZIP**.
